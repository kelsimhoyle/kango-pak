# KanGoPak - Project 3

## Concept 
One of the biggest concerns for travelers tends to revolve around packing.  Does it weigh too much? Did I forget something? What do I really need to bring?     

We aimed to help answer some of these traveler questions.  Our app allows users to provide their destination, length of trip, climate, apparel selection and size of suitcase

Using this information and some fun math, our app can help people pack a little lighter and take some of the stress of travel away.
